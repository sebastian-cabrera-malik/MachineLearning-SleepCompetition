    "    This metric is similar to IOU-threshold average precision metrics commonly\n",
    "    used in object detection. For events occuring in time series, we replace the\n",
    "    IOU threshold with a time tolerance.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Detailed Description\n",
    "    --------------------\n",
    "    Evaluation proceeds in four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Selection - (optional) Predictions not within a series' scoring\n",
    "    intervals are dropped.\n",
    "    2. Assignment - Predicted events are matched with ground-truth events.\n",
    "    3. Scoring - Each group of predictions is scored against its corresponding\n",
    "    group of ground-truth events via Average Precision.\n",
    "    4. Reduction - The multiple AP scores are averaged to produce a single\n",
    "    overall score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "    With each series there may be a defined set of scoring intervals giving the\n",
    "    intervals of time over which zero or more ground-truth events might be\n",
    "    annotated in that series. A prediction will be evaluated only if it falls\n",
    "    within a scoring interval. These scoring intervals can be chosen to improve\n",
    "    the fairness of evaluation by, for instance, ignoring edge-cases or\n",
    "    ambiguous events.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is recommended that, if used, scoring intervals be provided for training\n",
    "    data but not test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each set of predictions and ground-truths within the same `event x\n",
    "    tolerance x series_id` group, we match each ground-truth to the\n",
    "    highest-confidence unmatched prediction occurring within the allowed\n",
    "    tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some ground-truths may not be matched to a prediction and some predictions\n",
    "    may not be matched to a ground-truth. They will still be accounted for in\n",
    "    the scoring, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "    Collecting the events within each `series_id`, we compute an Average\n",
    "    Precision score for each `event x tolerance` group. The average precision\n",
    "    score is the area under the (step-wise) precision-recall curve generated by\n",
    "    decreasing confidence score thresholds over the predictions. In this\n",
    "    calculation, matched predictions over the threshold are scored as TP and\n",
    "    unmatched predictions as FP. Unmatched ground-truths are scored as FN.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "    The final score is the average of the above AP scores, first averaged over\n",
